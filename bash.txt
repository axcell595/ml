RuntimeError: Cannot use ``weights_only=True`` with files saved in the legacy .tar format. In PyTorch 2.6, we changed the default value of the `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True`. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.
None
Weight loading failed.
Ensure the model path is set and the weight file is in the specified model path.
