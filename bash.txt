# Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
# The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

# Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
